**Issue Summary:**

Our website experienced difficulties from 10:00 AM to 12:30 PM on April 7, 2024, affecting approximately 30% of users. The root cause was an overwhelming influx of users, causing strain on our system's capacity.

**Root Cause and Resolution:**

The surge in user traffic overwhelmed our system, leading to performance issues. We addressed the problem by temporarily increasing system capacity. To prevent future occurrences, we plan to enhance our system's ability to handle high traffic loads.

**Timeline:**

- **Detection:** Anomalies were detected at 9:55 AM through our monitoring system.
- **Investigation:** Engineers commenced troubleshooting at 10:00 AM, initially focusing on potential website errors.
- **Escalation:** Senior engineers were involved by 10:30 AM for further analysis.
- **Resolution:** A temporary fix was implemented by 11:30 AM to accommodate increased traffic.
- **Restoration:** Full service recovery was achieved by 12:30 PM as system stability returned.

**Corrective and Preventative Measures:**

- **Improvements/Fixes:**
  - Enhance system scalability to accommodate increased user loads.
  - Optimize database communication for improved efficiency.
- **Tasks:**
  1. Implement measures to bolster system scalability.
  2. Optimize database communication protocols to reduce strain.
  3. Enhance real-time monitoring capabilities for timely issue detection.
  4. Develop automated mechanisms for handling traffic surges.
  5. Conduct a thorough post-mortem analysis to fortify future incident response strategies.
